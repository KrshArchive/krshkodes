  <!-- BLOG-POST-LIST:START --><tr><td><a href="https://blog.krishguptadev.tech/open-source-my-experience-till-now">Open Source, my experience till now.</a></td><td><h2 id="what-is-open-source">What is open source?</h2>
<p>As per this <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Wikipedia Page</a> this is the definition of open source. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open-source software is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's break this down into simpler terms.</p>
<p>Open Source software are basically computer software that have their code open to the public.</p>
<p>These software usually allow users to study, improve, change and redistribute the code to everyone.</p>
<p>Or I may say open source is <strong>code that is designed to be publicly accessible</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633601877130/11fKEm2-9.png" alt="github.com_nhcarrigan.png" /></p>
<h3 id="is-it-for-people-other-than-programmers">Is it for people other than programmers?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no gatekeeping in Open Source, this fosters a real sense of collaboration, communication and career development"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-- @eddiejaoude</p>
<p>Open Source is not about code it is about collaboration and adding value. Every year a lot of no-code contributors join open source and this count increases every year.</p>
<p>Also, we're always making this barrier shorter and shorter. Now even asking questions about projects, giving suggestions for projects and reporting bugs are also contributions.</p>
<p>At the end of the day what matter's the most is how you can add value to a project.</p>
<p>The increase of no-code roles in #opensource python community</p>

<h3 id="why-should-you-open-source">Why should you open source?</h3>
<h4 id="impact">Impact</h4>
<p>By contributing to popular projects you can make a huge impact to the community Rocket But don't run for contributing to popular and big projects, it might demotivate you on the first run.</p>
<h4 id="experience">Experience</h4>
<p>By contributing to open source you get the real world experience you need. It can accelerate your skills! This can be a treat for you, but even if you have a good amount of experience, more never hurts.</p>
<h4 id="soft-skills">Soft-skills</h4>
<p>With open source, you can grow your soft skills like collaboration, public speaking, team work and a lot more. I would personally recommend you the <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/qyWssnMjrz">"Commit Your Code Community"</a> by @DThompsonDev.</p>
<h4 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h4>
<p>Companies might notice your contributions and offer you a job.</p>
<p>It's a fact that companies that run many open source projects, even recruit noticeable contributors.</p>
<h4 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h4>
<p>For instance, if you learnt a new programming language, you can contribute to a project using that language.</p>
<p>You can even learn a technology while contributing to projects. A great example in my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/appwrite/awesome-appwrite/pull/116">PR to Appwrite</a>, where learn a lot about Appwrite then wrote a article on Appwrite.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-it-like-to-open-source">How is it like to open source?</h2>
<p>I've been contributing to open source from earlier this month. I've contributed to 31 Repos, made 196 commits and 59 PRs. With almost no projects of self at all.</p>
<p>When contributing to Open Source it is just like working with a team. A team that includes millions of members and you working together.</p>
<p>Open Source is a big web of software. Let's talk about Next.js, a really popular open source project. It uses 266 more open source projects to work. Similarly a number of projects have nextjs as a requirement. And the list goes on and on.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://npm.anvaka.com/#/view/2d/next"><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633668502646/r3dZ43IOJ.png" alt="image.png" /></a></p>
<p>When you contribute to a given open source project. You are contributing to every single project the project is a dependant of the project you contribute to. Can you feel the impact now?</p>
<p>Open Source is like collaborating with people across the globe for a specific feature/bug/documentation update or more.</p>
<p>Like the limitless possibilities of projects are there, similarly there are limitless possibilities for contributions and indirectly no-code contributions.</p>
<p>I would recommend you to consider all contributions as contributions. Some people think no-code contributions are inferior but they aren't. At the end of the day what matters the most is the value being added to projects.</p>
<p>Don't run after contributions, run after adding value. That's what I did and recommend you.</p>
<p>Help review other people's contributions, make them better, that's also adding value.</p>
<p>I'd like to talk about some of my contributions that relate to this. This is about the popular <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree">Linkfree project</a>, While others were making multiple pull requests, I was adding value to their PRs instead of creating my own PRs. I hardly made 2 PRs that too fixing typos. I didn't even made a PR to add my own profile yet. But still I made contributions. Today, GitHub recognises me as one of the Top 5 Contributors of this month.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1633670768999/v47S9E_NK6.png" alt="github.com_EddieHubCommunity_LinkFree.png" /></p>
<p>This completely proves that adding value matters not how much or how.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-pr">My first PR</h3>
<p>I made my GitHub Account at 30th September, exactly the day I turned 13. Hacktoberfest was a day ahead. What makes sense for me is to make pull requests to practice Hacktoberfest.</p>
<p>My first PR is proudly to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/hacktoberfest-practice">EddieHubCommunity/Hacktoberfest-Practice</a>. I just added my name. But still, what matters is that I learnt how to use github.</p>
<p>You can also visit your first pr via this website: https://firstpr.me</p>
<h3 id="the-most-challenging-issue-i-worked-on">The most challenging issue I worked on.</h3>
<p>This was my first time building a complete project as a contribution. I proudly contributed to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/web3community/devprotocol.xyz/issues/2">Web3Community/devprotocol.xyz</a>.</p>
<p>I brought the design to code. Automated deployments, created basic documentation.</p>
<p>Yeah, all of this was broken down into 4-6 PRs, since it's a protip to make frequent but small and quality PRs rather than Big and huge prs.</p>
<p>I learned how to work with <a target="_blank" href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwindcss</a>.</p>
<p>This was my first time automating with GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>I learnt a lot of technologies along the go. This also tells us that you can contribute to project while learning what the project uses.</p>
<h3 id="my-favourite-open-source-project">My Favourite Open Source Project</h3>
<p>I am currently learning front-end dev, so I have really little idea about backend. I encountered a project called <a target="_blank" href="https://krishguptadev.hashnode.dev/appwrite-all-you-need-to-know">Appwrite</a>. It has a lot of features that can reduce my effort while building backends. My favourite one is Authentication and Teams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Appwrite is a self-hosted solution that provides developers with a set of easy-to-use and integrate REST APIs to manage their core backend needs.</p>
<p>Think of Appwrite as a complete toolkit of APIs and Tools with a management console UI to help you make application faster and more efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-- https://krishguptadev.hashnode.dev/appwrite-all-you-need-to-know</p>
<h3 id="contributing-no-code">Contributing No-Code</h3>
<p>As, I've already proved that no-code contributions are as valuable as code contributions. It totally makes sense for me to have experienced it. I have <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/web3community/brand-assets/issues/4">contributed</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/issues/1983">no-code</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/classroom-monitor-bot/issues/10">in</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/web3community/devprotocol.xyz/issues/23">several</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/issues/381">occasions</a></p>
<p>When It comes to no-code. The best you could out from someone is a one that contributes to no-code on a regular basis. That's what I do too. I don't target no-code contributions but somehow these come in front of me and I contribute to them.</p>
<p>As I stated their are infinite possibilities for no-code contributions, I would state a few here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing Typos</li>
<li>Writing Documention</li>
<li>Reporting Issues</li>
<li>Giving Suggestions</li>
</ul>
<p>I recently contributed to writing documentation for a discord bot.</p>
<p>Here's the what I did and how I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Asked if I could contribute documentation to the project</li>
<li>Installed a instance of that bot on my local machine</li>
<li>Used and understood, what all the bot could do.</li>
<li>Asked the maintainers about what all should I add in the documentation.</li>
<li>It's somewhat similar to writing a blog: Wrote the documentation, and used screenshots to better explain the bot</li>
<li>Made a Pull Request to the project.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="common-open-source-terms">Common Open Source Terms</h2>
<p>Issues: Reported Suggestions/Bugs or the project</p>
<p>Commit: A change in the files of the code</p>
<p>Pull Request: A request to accept a small collection of commits by a contributor</p>
<p>Tags: A collection of commits, something like a release</p>
<p>Hacktoberfest: A month long festival in october, where people contribute 4 PRs to open source and receive swag t-shirts</p>
<h2 id="basic-git-commands">Basic Git Commands</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>git init</code>: Create a new git repo</li>
<li><code>git clone &lt;repo&gt;</code>: Clone a remote repository to you local machine</li>
<li><code>git add &lt;files&gt;</code>: Mark some changes for committing</li>
<li><code>git commit -m "&lt;message&gt;"</code>: Commit the changes marked in <code>git add</code></li>
<li><code>git push</code>: Send the changes to a remote host</li>
<li><code>git pull</code>: Retrieve the latest changes from a remote host</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="appwrites-features">Appwrite's Features</h2>
<p>Appwrite has a lot of features, let's discuss about the a few of the ones that you'll require in almost every project.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-and-account-management">Authentication and Account Management</h3>
<p>The account server allows you to create users, authenticate users, manage users, manage user activity logs.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creating a account</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> sdk = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Appwrite()

sdk
  .setEndpoint(proccess.env.ENDPOINT).setProject(process.env.PROJECT_ID)

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> promise = sdk.account.create(<span class="hljs-string">'email@example.com'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'password'</span>)

promise.then(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">response</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(response)
}, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">error</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(error)
})
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Fetch a account</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> sdk = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Appwrite()

sdk
  .setEndpoint(proccess.env.ENDPOINT).setProject(process.env.PROJECT_ID)

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> promise = sdk.account.create(<span class="hljs-string">'email@example.com'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'password'</span>)

promise.then(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">response</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(response)
}, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">error</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(error)
})
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Authenticating the user with password</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> sdk = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Appwrite()

sdk
  .setEndpoint(proccess.env.ENDPOINT).setProject(process.env.PROJECT_ID)

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> promise = sdk.account.createSession(<span class="hljs-string">'email@example.com'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'password'</span>)

promise.then(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">response</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(response)
}, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">error</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(error)
})
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a lot more you can do with it like Oauth2, Magic URL Sessions, JWT Auth, Fetch Account Preferences, Update Accounts, Email verifications and more: https://appwrite.io/docs/client/account</p>
<h3 id="database-api">Database API</h3>
<p>The Database API is just like a document-based database something like MongoDB. You can use this API to create, list, fetch, update and delete documents.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create document</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> sdk = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Appwrite()

sdk
  .setEndpoint(proccess.env.ENDPOINT).setProject(process.env.PROJECT_ID)

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> promise = sdk.database.createDocument(<span class="hljs-string">'YOUR_COLLECTION_ID'</span>, {})

promise.then(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">response</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(response)
}, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">error</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(error)
})
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>List Documents</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> sdk = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Appwrite()

sdk
  .setEndpoint(proccess.env.ENDPOINT).setProject(process.env.PROJECT_ID)

 <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> promise = sdk.database.listDocuments(<span class="hljs-string">'YOUR_COLLECTION_ID'</span>)

promise.then(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">response</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(response)
}, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">error</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(error)
})
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also fetch, update and delete these in a similar way, checkout the docs for more: https://appwrite.io/docs/client/database</p>
<h3 id="functions-api">Functions API</h3>
<p>Appwrite allows you to create backend functions that are triggered by Appwrite system events or cron jobs.</p>
<p>You can learn more by following their <a target="_blank" href="https://appwrite.io/docs/functions">Cloud Functions tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>You can create, list or fetch executions using this API.</p>
<p>This is the last one I'm covering but, Appwrite also has Teams, Storage, Localization, Avatars and Health APIs</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>At this point of time you might be wondering, how do I install such a cool thing? </p>
<p>If you use unix</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">docker run -it --rm \
    --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    --volume <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-subst">$(pwd)</span>"</span>/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw \
    --entrypoint=<span class="hljs-string">"install"</span> \
    appwrite/appwrite:0.10.4
</code></pre>
<p>If you use windows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">docker run -it --rm ^
    --volume //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
    --volume <span class="hljs-string">"%cd%"</span>/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw ^
    --entrypoint=<span class="hljs-string">"install"</span> ^
    appwrite/appwrite:0.10.4
</code></pre>
<h2 id="30daysofappwrite">30DaysOfAppwrite</h2>
<p>If you are familiar with things like 100DaysOfCode, you might have understood this till now. It's all about learning Appwrite in 30Days by making projects. I am also starting to do this and I recommend to you to: https://30days.appwrite.io/</p>
<h2 id="demos">Demos</h2>
<p>If you are still not sure, here's a list of projects made using appwrite: https://github.com/appwrite/awesome-appwrite#showcase-built-with-appwrite-</p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>If you need any help, feel free to ask the doubt in the comments or ask the appwrite community in their discord server: https://discord.gg/GSeTUeA</p>
